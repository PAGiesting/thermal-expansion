Notes on data files:
albAmel: "010" and "100" files all lay directly on top of each other.
	001-r19c = 001-s1r1 and 001-r2 = 001-s1r2 (or maybe swap the RHS's)
anorShaws: one file
byto: 	four distinct files
	go back and check which one is which
fmt:	100-sBr1 arch ending by 450 C
	100-sBr2 underneath 010-sCr1(8c) all three overlay *almost* exactly
	001-sAr1 off on its own
moon:	seven distinct files visible
	three files climb, flatline, climb, done by 450 C, from bottom to top:
		s1r2, s2r2, s3r2
	p2s2r2: sharp rise from negative to ~250, drop to ~600, rise
	s1r1:	flatter but otherwise like p2s2r2
	s2r1:	broad flat curve
	s3r1:	shallow drop to ~175, rise to ~750, shallow drop
oligHawk: 001:	s1r1 rise to 250, drop to 575, sharp rise
		s1r2 rise to 175, drop to 300, done by 400
		s1r5 broad flat concave down
	010:	s1r3, s1r4 on top of each other, like "001" s1r5
oligTanz: "010" and "100" directly on top of each other
	  concave down a lot like oligHawk s1r3, 4, 5 "001" and "010"
sanMtT:	none of these pass 125 C yet alpha ranges from -5e-5 to 3e-5
	p1s1r17c, p2s1r1: sharp rise to 45, flat to 65, rise to 80
	p2s1r16mm: sharp rise to 70, flat to 105, turning upward to 125
	p3s1r1: like p1/2s1r1 but steeper
